Weights
Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing 
𝑊
W units. He also has three weights each of 
𝑋
,
𝑌
,
X,Y, and 
𝑍
Z units respectively. Help him determine whether he can measure the exact weight of the object with one or more of these weights.

If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print YES, otherwise print NO.

solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void can_measure_weight(int T) {
    while (T--) {
        int W, X, Y, Z;
        cin >> W >> X >> Y >> Z;
        
        // Check all combinations of weights
        if (W == X || W == Y || W == Z || 
            W == X + Y || W == X + Z || W == Y + Z || 
            W == X + Y + Z) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;  // Number of test cases
    
    can_measure_weight(T);
    
    return 0;
}
