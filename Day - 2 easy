Subscriptions
A new TV streaming service was recently started in Chefland called the Chef-TV.

A group of 
𝑁
N friends in Chefland want to buy Chef-TV subscriptions. We know that 
6
6 people can share one Chef-TV subscription. Also, the cost of one Chef-TV subscription is 
𝑋
X rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of 
𝑁
N friends will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Chef-TV.


solution:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T;  
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int N, X;  
        cin >> N >> X;

        
        int subscriptions = (N + 5) / 6;  

       
        int totalCost = subscriptions * X;

        
        cout << totalCost << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
