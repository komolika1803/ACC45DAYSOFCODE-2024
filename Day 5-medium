public class ElectionResult {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a scanner object to take input
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Input the number of test cases
        int T = sc.nextInt();

        // Loop through each test case
        for (int t = 0; t < T; t++) {
            // Input votes for party A, B, and C
